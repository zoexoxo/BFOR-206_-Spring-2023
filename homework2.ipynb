The emotional hook is that you get invested in your favourite characters and want them to do well, but also love that they all support each other and care about each other doing well.

A lot of you men have families and some of you have children. What do you want to do? I have nothing to lose.\" Shunning surrender, around 2:00 p.m. on August 2, the men swam towards Plum Pudding island 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southwest of the remains of PT-109.[33][44] Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth.[45] Kennedy made an additional two-mile swim the night of August 2, 1943, to Ferguson Passage to attempt to hail a passing American PT boat to expedite his crew's rescue and attempted to make the trip on a subsequent night, in a damaged canoe found on Naru Island where he had swum with Ensign George Ross to look for food.[46]\n",

They swam against a strong current, and once again Kennedy towed the badly burned motor machinist \"Pappy\" MacMahon by his life vest. The somewhat larger Olasana Island had ripe coconut trees, but still no fresh water.[47] On the following day, August 5, Kennedy and Ensign George Ross made the one hour swim to Naru Island, an additional distance of about .5 miles (0.80 km) southwest, in search of help and food. Kennedy and Ross found a small canoe, packages of crackers, candy and a fifty-gallon drum of drinkable water left by the Japanese, which Kennedy paddled another half mile back to Olasana in the acquired canoe to provide his hungry crew. Lieutenant \"Bud\" Liebenow, a friend and former tentmate of Kennedy's, rescued Kennedy and his crew on Olasana Island on August 8, 1943 aboard his boat, PT-157, with the help of coast watcher Lieutenant Reginald Evans and several native coast watchers, particularly Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana.[48][49][50][51]\n",

In 9th grade we had to read Ender’s Game, it’s what got me into reading sci-fi literature. The first 2 or 3 are definitely the best but you can’t knock the man for 4th one, trying to wrap up the series. I personally like Ender’s Shadow,Shadow of the Giant, and Shadow Puppets series. Card also has several other books that are pretty interesting reading. Maps in a Mirror is a pretty good book full of short stories that’ll make you scratch your head; and Treason is quite an interesting book as well.\n",

The accounting program there is Top 3 in the nation, and MBA is Top 25?-ish? All the big accounting and consulting firms, (and to a lesser degree, tech companies) were falling over themselves to come recruit from the programs there. Average job placement rate is 95%+, and we usually had 3-5 offers waiting for us upon graduation. All the major armed forces and federal gov departments held multiple recruiting visits; extra bonus points if you spoke Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, or any Asian language. Lots of our returned missionaries went on to study additional languages just so they could join up...(once you've learned a 2nd language, it's usually easier to learn a 3rd / 4th, etc.) \n",

We all (not the missionaries) drank beer by the lake and had a bon fire. We bought them near beer and watched them burn their undergarments on the end of a big stick.

      ">Miller had been assigned to interview emigrés like Svetlana Ogorodnikov, but she was much better at her job than he was at his. His performance as an agent had been lackluster, and his personal life was not going much better, as, not long before his arrest, he was excommunicated from the Mormon church for adultery. **Soon, he and Svetlana were sleeping together, and discussing plans to exchange information for money.** Miller later said he was trying to use Svetlana as a source, not the other way around, but **he did pass a classified document to her and her husband, Nikolay.**\n",
      "\n",
      ">After Miller had told his superiors about his relationship with Svetlana, at his trial, testimony revealed a tangle of religion and work at the Los Angeles bureau where he worked. One Mormon FBI agent said that he’d understood that Miller had been put under his command, on a prestigious counterintelligence squad, “because of our common religious background.” Another agent, Matt Perez, testified that Richard T. Bretzing, the head of the L.A. bureau and a Mormon bishop, had protected Miller and kept him from being fired.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Not long before Miller’s Soviet dalliance came to light, Perez, a Latino FBI agent, had filed his first discrimination complaint with the equal employment opportunity office. In the course of the next few years, he, along with more than 300 other agents, would file a class action suit against the FBI for racial and religious discrimination. Part of their complaint was that their Mormon higher-ups had favored agents of their own religion.\n",
      "\n",
      ">The judge ruled in the Hispanic agents’ favor, on the racial discrimination charge, and though he rejected the religious discrimination charges, he did write that the testimony at the trial showed that Mormon leader “made personnel decisions which favored members of their church at the expense of Hispanic class members.”\n",

People in the LDS church generally pay 10% of their incomes as tithing to the church. Missionaries these days all pay the same amount for their missions, regardless of where in the world they serve. Some missionaries serve in nice areas, like mine in Sydney where rents were sky high. Some missionaries serve in very inexpensive parts of the world. A ton of missionaries’ expenses are offset by tithing donations, and if family’s can’t afford to send their kids on missions, then tithing funds cover for them. In my mission, there were many missionaries from the pacific islands whose missions were entirely financed by tithing from other members. \n",

The reason being is he doesn't go into the idea that that's all black people are. He's spoken on it a few times how he often will not take roles like Denzel, despite being offered them. You can watch any Denzel movie, and he'll often speak exactly where he came from: the streets of New York. He's not afraid to say 'amberlance' or 'axe' you a question. Smith did not come from the streets. He was raised Baptist in Pennsylvania and went to private school his whole life. So it makes sense. You're asking him to imitate something he's not, he won't do it because he doesn't have to. Denzel however, he literally was a step away from being a banger in New York.

Pretty cool contrast between the two, but I've always respected Smith's take on why he doesn't do that, and respected how nobody has ever asked Denzel to explain why he speaks like, or rather, why he can speak like that so believably.\n",

      "\n",
      "To explain this, we need to remember what cancer is. A single cell somewhere in the body goes haywire, and starts rapidly and uncontrollably reproducing. The type of that original cell determines what sort of cancer you have. If it's a breast cell, you have breast cancer. If it's a bone cell, you have bone cancer. If it's a skin cell, you have skin cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, the cells divide and reproduce at the site of the initial cell that went haywire. This forms a tumor. Depending on where this tumor is located in the body influences how easily it's noticed and what side effects it produces. With some cancers, the initial tumor typically isn't noticed unless it's caught by pure chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a certain point, cells from the tumor will separate and spread through the body. How they spread depends on the type of cancer, but it can be through the lymph system, the blood, or directly through tissue. These cells will land in other parts of the body, and continue dividing, creating new tumors. These are the metastases. The side effects of a metastatic tumor, again, depend on where it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "With cancers like pancreatic cancer, a person often seeks medical care for a symptom they think is relatively minor, only to find out that it's the result of having multiple tumors throughout their body. At the time, they seem relatively healthy and fine - but we've already reached a point where there's nothing that can be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Cancer sucks because it spreads exponentially. Every single cancer cell will divide into two new cancer cells. Different cancers do this at different rates, but it's generally very quickly. By the time a tumor goes from microscopic to macroscopic and able to cause symptoms, it can expand VERY rapidly. \n",
      "\n",
      "To make matters worse, a person isn't \"cured\" from cancer until every single cancer cell is dead. Killing 99.9999% of their cancer will significantly extend their life, but if even one cell survives, it's no different than the single cancer cell that set the whole thing in motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difficulty is killing these malfunctioning cells without also killing the regular cells that the body needs survive. Depending on the type of cell that turned cancerous, and the exact mutation, this can be easier or harder. Radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery all focus on killing (or removing) cancer cells while leaving the healthy ones unaffected as much as possible. If the tumors are in the brain, for example, it can be extremely difficult to treat. Surgery is difficult to impossible, due to the potential damage to the brain. Chemotherapy can be significantly less effective due to the \"blood brain barrier\", with many drugs not being able to cross it. Radiation can be an option, but successfully killing 100.00% of the cancer (and not 99.9999%) while also not causing excessive damage can be difficult if not impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for how the person dies, well, the bigger the tumors, the faster they grow. The bigger a tumor, the more likely it will spread and additional tumors will start growing. They effectively take over the whole body, if the person survives long enough. Eventually, one of them disrupts something important. It could be in the brain. It could be with the heart. It could be in the body. Some people die relatively quickly as their brain is shut down, while others experience unimaginable agony as their bones break from the inside out from tumors. \n",

Also, the most common way to deal with these is radiation, which destroys the host's body. The end result is usually failure in killing all of the metastasized cancers, huge damage(and pain) to the host's body, and death by either the main cancer or the small ones erupting due to the main cancer ceasing to function/dying.

Research is making progress, though, and we might soon have a [universal cancer test](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323898.php). The problem with this, which I discuss further below, is that we might actually be better off not knowing...\n",
      "\n",
      "There's an argument that early detection does *not* have an effect on survival rates, and might just negatively effect a patient's quality of life. In breast cancer, for example, there has been an ongoing debate about [\"overtreatment\"](https://bcaction.org/2014/04/08/early-detection-does-not-save-lives/).\n",
      "\n",
      "The aggressiveness of the cancer, not just that it's been detected early, is the real question. If it's a slow developing cancer, you might not need to worry about it because you'll die of other causes. This is often the case for prostate cancer. Once it is detected, however, well now you have that to think about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, if it's a rapidly developing cancer, detecting it early still might not be enough time for treatment options to work, exposes the patient to adverse effects, and makes little change to the mortality rate. Except those patients also suffered through brutal treatment, which in many cases, is worse than the cancer itself.\n",

      "\n",
      ">The bottom line is that the ever-earlier detection of many diseases, particularly cancer, is not necessarily an unalloyed good. As the detection threshold moves ever earlier in the course of a disease or abnormality (in the case of cancer, to ever smaller tumors all the way down to the level of clusters of cells), the apparent prevalence of the disease being screened for increases, and abnormalities that may never turn into the disease start to be detected at an increasing frequency. In other words, the signal-to-noise ratio falls precipitously. This has consequences. It leads, at the very minimum, to more testing and may lead us to treating abnormalities that may never result in disease that affects the patient, which at the very minimum leads to patient anxiety and at the very worst leads to treatments that put the patient at risk of complications and do the patient no good.\n",

The car was totaled and the dog's owner was fortunately wearing her seat belt as well, and the owner had to be stretchered out but fortunately only suffered a moderate concussion and whiplash injuries. I was able to treat the dog as an outpatient for whiplash and some bruising/soft tissue swelling in the armpits from the harness, and the dog and the owner both made full recovery. That dog 100% would've been dead from that crash if it wasn't secured and he ended up as a projectile through the windshield. Everyone should wear their seat belt and secure their pets too.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Development is largely \"UX driven\". So far, so good; user experience is alpha and omega in a platform built on user interaction and user contributions.\n",
      "* The people responsible for UX are less concerned with the actual *user experience* than the visual design, layout and overall structure; \"UX\" work is laid out more like concept design for flows of user interaction and no one has ownership of the entire \"user experience\" in the literal, broader sense of the word.\n",
      "* As a result, development is focused on visual trivialities and new ways to represent the same information when greater gains in user experience could be had by improving technological robustness.\n",
      "* As a result, the interface frequently changes and causes confusion; there is no representation of \"user experience\" in the broad sense that might encompass the user experience over time as changes constantly break users' expectations.\n",
      "* People use the product/service despite these shortcomings, so who cares? A silly redesign is going to attract more attention than a video player that doesn't spaz out half of the time because the longevity of the issue has kept withered down expectations.\n",

They don't realize I count every carb, calorie, fat and protein that goes in my mouth. I go to the gym daily and I eat bariatric keto. One of the biggest obstacles I've faced in the process is the judgement you receive when you start your weight loss journey. Everyone has strong opinions on what you should be doing. Instead of saying keep up the good work, they prefer to tell you how they could do it better. It is extremely discouraging. Also, most people in the US haven't been taught how to eat properly, even doctors do fly by nutritional training in their education. We've been taught to eat high carb and low fat. When really that is a terrible diet. Eat processed grains rather than natural foods. Our understanding of nutrition is broken and our people are fat because of it. \n",

It's not like we can just get up one morning and decide \"todays the day im gonna start losing weight\" and then exercise and change our eating habits immediately. But its not impossible, i think we need to mentally prepare ourselves, and take one small step at a time. People dont understand that eating habits are programmed into your brain, for instance i usually have a midnight snack, and if i dont eat that then i actually get hungry and it feels like i need to eat it or else i'll die, but i know (in the part of my brain i dont wanna listen to) i dont need it to survive. I've been thinkin i need to lose weight, so for me i think the first step is cutting the midnight snack, which will not be an easy task. I would like to thank you for sharing your struggle and although i know no words of encouragement from a stranger on the internet will change your mind/life i just want to tell you i think its mind over matter. If you think this is something that you can NEVER change then you wont even think of trying, but if you dont look at the overall picture and find one thing (something you eat, standing for intermittent periods of time while watching tv) to use as a starting point i think you can start to gradually change your mind if not your life. \n",

      "\n",
      "- All the evidence we have tells us that weight loss is most effective and long-lasting with social support.  I think Weight Watchers does something like this, as do others.  When people going through the same issues as you talk on a regular basis, you learn new skills together, support each other when someone slips up, and come out the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "- As odd as it sounds, stop thinking about the weight.  Start thinking about your health.  We know adults need 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise a week.  We know they need 2 days of resistance exercise a week.  Spend a month trying different activities until you find something you enjoy (running, biking, boxing, hiking, swimming is great for joints, elliptical, aerobic/dance classes, etc. And light weight lifting, heavy lifting, lifting classes, bands at home, whatever -just make sure you’re increasing intensity over time and that you’re not going to get bulky).  Remember, you won’t enjoy it if you spend the whole time judging yourself.  Try to lose yourself in the activity.  adding yoga once a week is great for calming down the mental issues associated with obesity, including anxiety, judgment, stress, dissociation from your body, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Once you identify what you like, figure out a habit you can stick to.  Set low, medium, and high goals (I’d like to hit the gym every day, but I’m going to try for 3x a week, with a minimum of once a week on a bad week).  Then don’t even worry about the exercise.  The goal is, over the course of a month, to just show up at the gym 3x/week.  It doesn’t even matter what you do once you arrive or how long you stay, just that you get there.  That’s the habit you want to form.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The nutrition stuff can be similar.  Instead of thinking about weight loss, think about developing health and habits.  If you drink soda, stop.  Make sure you have one salad with some type of protein each day.  Prioritize having a healthy breakfast and make a healthy dinner easy.  Don’t think about depriving yourself, think about treating your body to healthy, nutritious foods.  You may still have a donut here or ice cream there, but make sure that 9/10 meals fuel your body with healthy nutrients.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, instead of even thinking about weight loss, just do this for six months.  Get to know your body again in a healthy way.  Learn to appreciate what your body is capable of.  Make your new “normal” consistent weekly physical activity and consistent healthy fuel.  Don’t judge yourself.  Just be.\n",
      "\n",

However, if you're cooking at home, there are plenty of cheap, healthy-ish options. Canned vegetables and fruits (particularly canned beans) are sold for just over a dollar if you buy store brand. Dried beans are also cheap and go a long way. You can get a large bag of chicken for less than $10 and if you know how to cook it, you can make that last for meals. Fresh produce is better purchased just a few at a time, when you know you'll eat it, rather than a lot and you end up letting it rot...The real issue when it comes to budgeting/unhealthy options is the \"food deserts\" that exist. In many communities, there aren't actual grocery stores. People rely on the food aisles of Dollar General or their convenience store, and those *are* full of chips and high-sodium canned soups and HungryMan frozen dinners. Even the same chain of grocery stores will have wildly different stores in different neighborhoods--we have a chain called Schnucks where I am, and there are \"good\" Schnucks, with the deli and the large produce section and the salad bar and the organic aisles and freezer case of meat alternatives, and \"bad\" Schnucks, with literally three aisles of chips and snack food, with an aisle of beer, and one tiny corner of some sad wilted lettuce. I will let you guess which store is in which neighborhood...but if you're looking at restaurant prices and assuming it's cheaper to eat unhealthy, compare restaurant prices (even that fast food burger) with what you can make at home and realize that you can eat much healthier for a fraction of the price.\n",

      "I got to meet Gene Wilder in 2010. I was a waiter at a restaurant in NYC and his godson was having a private birthday party in the back room of our restaurant. I had been advised that he was an amateur sommelier and was bringing the wine for dinner. When Mr. Wilder arrived, he couldn't have been kinder. He asked my recommendation for a white wine before dinner and then for an entree suggestion based on the red wine he'd brought for the party. He made it a point to sincerely let me know he enjoyed both of my recommendations after they had arrived. \n",

      "At the end of dinner, the guests took turns making toasts. When it was Mr. Wilder's turn, he simply stood up and opened his mouth to sing a few bars of a made up song. The only words were, \"I love you, love you, love you, yes I love you, love you, love you.\" I got big tears in my eyes. He was humble, kind, so full of love for his family and friends. I had the opportunity to peer into the life of one of my favorite comedians, and he was every bit as grand as I had imagined. Rest in Peace, Mr. Wilder. Thank you for all the laughs.     \n",

And while it seems heartless to say so... 50 years without him, only 2 or 3 years with him... What exactly is it that she still misses? What \"real\" memories still remain? I see her whole wasted life as a reason to never lament being an atheist. Saying that, I'd be absolutely gutted if I lost my wife, and I don't think I would be able to carry on. But if she goes first and I don't swallow a bottle of something, then by the hammer of grabthar, I *will* move on.\n",
